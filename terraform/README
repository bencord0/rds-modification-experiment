# I just want an RDS instance!

This is about the minimum you need to get a database, somewhere on the internet.

### Getting started

    $ export AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

(Or if you're me)

    $ source <(pass aws.amazon.com/$account_id)

    $ terraform init
    $ terrafor apply

### What is this?

This directory contains just enough to bring up a new RDS instance on the
public internet from a fresh AWS account.

There are two terraform files here. They are named after the area of the AWS API
that they concern.

Obviously, you need a VPC. Everything is in a VPC these days.

`vpc.tf` creates a VPC with two AZs (the minimum needed to make a sensible RDS
deployment).

The rest of the gunk in there is stuff like:
- IPv4 and IPv6
- NATs or egress routers
- Routing tables to glue it to the internet

`rds.tf` creates a database.
Play with the parameters, go have fun.
